Certainly! Here’s a README.md tailored for the [idj997/Applied_Stats](https://github.com/idj997/Applied_Stats) repository, based on the files and context visible in your link.

# Applied_Stats

This repository contains coursework and Jupyter Notebooks for an Applied Statistics course. Each notebook demonstrates core techniques and concepts in applied statistics, using Python and common data analysis libraries.

## Contents

- **Stats_Coursework_1.ipynb**  
  Exploratory analysis and statistical inference on an example dataset. Includes graphical analysis and tests for normality, as well as confidence interval calculation and hypothesis testing.

- **Stats_coursework2 (1).ipynb**  
  Statistical modeling and regression analysis. Covers fitting linear regression models, interpreting coefficients, and evaluating model assumptions.

- **Stats_Coursework_3 (1).ipynb**  
  Advanced topics such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and additional regression diagnostics. May include use of categorical predictors and interactions.

- **Stats_Coursework_4 (1).ipynb**  
  Multivariate statistics, including principal component analysis (PCA) and/or logistic regression. Further data analysis with visualization of multivariate relationships.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks, you’ll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Standard Python packages for data science, such as:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy
  - statsmodels
  - scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels scikit-learn notebook
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idj997/Applied_Stats.git
   cd Applied_Stats
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open any of the `.ipynb` files and run the notebook cells in order for a step-by-step walkthrough.**
